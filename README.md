# Quote App

## Description

Quote App is a simple quote application that incorporates a new CSS framework and consumes two APIs. It displays the quote of the day and features a popular quote from a trending celebrity. The app utilizes server-side APIs to retrieve response data objects from both the random quote API and They Said So API.
