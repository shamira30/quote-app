## User Stories

As a User, I would like you to build a simple quote application that incorporates a new CSS framework and consumes two APIs.

## Description

Quote App is an app to display the quote of the day and features a popluar quote from a trending celebrity. The server-side API used to get response data object is retrieved from both: random quote API and They Said So API.

In pertinence to local storage, the previous search city is displayed to the user on the right side of the page. The user is also able to load a new random quote by pressing the new quote button.
